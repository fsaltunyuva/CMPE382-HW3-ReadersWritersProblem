## Homework 3 - Reader-writer problem with password in C Language and on Linux

Implement a solution to the **Reader-Writer problem** (see the texbook and lecture notes)
with **password** authentication using threads and semaphores in C programming
language on a Linux platform.

The program should create two types of threads: reader
and **writer**. Each thread must acquire a unique password from a table to access the
database (a global variable **BUFFER**). There can be a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 9
readers/writers. So, any combination of readers and writers is possible, such as (1,1), (1,2) …
(1,9), (2,1) … (9,1) … or (5,5).


The writers can write a random number in the range 0-9999 to BUFFER, each time it has
an access to it. Let each writer/reader sleep 1 second before consecutive writing/reading.


The password table is filled with 10 random 6 digit numbers before being used, in the
main process.


Each reader/writer is allocated a unique password from the table. The shared resource
(**BUFFER**) should only be accessible after being checked for the password.


Furthermore, create equal number of dummy readers and writers with random passwords,
not included in the password table. For example, if there are 2 readers and 3 writers, there
will be 2 dummy readers and 3 dummy writers.


Hint: You are free to make any assumption, as long as you document it.

### Tasks

1. Design a program structure that creates reader and writer threads, each requiring
a unique password for access.

2. Implement semaphore based synchronization to control access to the password
and the shared resource BUFFER.

3. Ensure exclusive access to the password file to prevent race conditions and
duplicate passwords.

4. Ensure that readers can access the resource simultaneously with the correct
password without interfering with each other.

5. Ensure that writers have exclusive access to the resource with the correct password,
preventing simultaneous access by readers or other writers.

6. Test the program with three cases with different numbers of readers and writers.
Each reader/writer can do 5 operations.. Note that the total number of real readers
and writers cannot exceed 10.

7. Each time BUFFER is accessed by real or dummy readers&writers, the following
output is produced in the form of a table. In total, 3 tables are created. Thread No - Validity(real/dummy) - Role(reader/writer) - Value read/written

### Requirements

* Utilize POSIX threads (pthread) library for multi-threading.

* Implement appropriate synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.

* Write clear and concise code with proper error handling.

* Include comments to explain the logic and functionality.

* Submit both the source code and test results.
